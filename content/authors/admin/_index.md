Welcome to my personal website! I'm currently a junior undergraduate student majoring in computational mathematics at Peking University, fourtunately having Prof. Liwei Wang as my research advisor. My research interest includes theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning, statistics and optimization, as well as their applications in other scientific disciplines. My work is often built on leveraging mathematical tools to get unique insights into real-world problems. If you share similar interest, feel free to contact me via email or Wechat.
