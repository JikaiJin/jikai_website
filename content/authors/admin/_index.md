Welcome to my personal website! I am a second year Ph.D. student in [The Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME)](https://icme.stanford.edu/), [Stanford university](https://www.stanford.edu/). Prior to joining Stanford, I obtained my bachelor degree in computational mathematics in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), fortunately having [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) as my research advisor. My research is highly interdisciplinary across machine learning, statistics and operations research. While currently focusing on theoretical aspects, the ultimate goal of my research is to develop state-of-the-art solutions for important real-world problems. If you share similar interest, feel free to contact me via email or Wechat.
